## Description

Iris is an all-in-one caregiver tool that makes your device into a full-fledged
care management system.

### Features

- 💊 Medication management - A simple to navigate interface to manage and log
  taken medication
- 📈 Patient Reported Outcome tracking - A questionnaire for patients to keep
  track of their quality of care
- 📝 Care instructions documentation - Leave notes for all caregivers to stay on
  the same page
- 📹️ Video monitoring - Record your patient while you're away to ensure they're
  getting the best possible quality (Windows/macOS only)
- 👥 Contacts - A list of contacts for nurses and caregivers to keep in contact

### Motivation

Many of us in Ojos Project have experienced needing to care for a family member
with a serious illness. We saw first-hand the limits of technology in the
hospice space. We came together to build modern tools not just for the hospice
space, but for the palliative care space as a whole. 🩵
